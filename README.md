# 🔐 Computer Security – Course Summary

This repository summarizes the core concepts I learned in my Computer Security course, covering foundational principles, cryptography, system security, network security, web security, usability, and privacy.
### Book suggested by my instructor to expand your knowledge in security
- Introduction to Computer Security, Michael Goodrich, Roberto Tamassia (First Edition)


### Topics Covered

- **Foundations:** Goals of security (confidentiality, integrity, availability), security domains, physical security  
- **Cryptography:** Symmetric vs asymmetric encryption (DES, AES, RSA), Diffie-Hellman, Needham-Schroeder, PKI, hashing  
- **OS Security:** Process isolation, buffer overflows, system-level vulnerabilities  
- **Malware:** Viruses, attack strategies, countermeasures  
- **Network Security:** Data link, network, and transport layer protections  
- **Web Security:** SSL/TLS, server-side and client-side attacks, authentication, password security  
- **Usability & Security:** Human-centered security, usability vs protection trade-offs  
- **Privacy:** Importance of privacy, privacy policies, global perspectives  


### Key Takeaway
Security is not just cryptography or firewalls — it is a layered, system-wide, and human-aware discipline.
